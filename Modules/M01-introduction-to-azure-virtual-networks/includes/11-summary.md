
As your organization moves to Azure, you must design a secure virtual networking environment that provides connectivity and name resolution for both virtual and on-premises resources. Users must be able to access the resources they need smoothly and securely, regardless of where they are accessing the network from.

In this module you saw a broad overview of some of the most crucial aspects of designing and planning an Azure virtual network, including planning VNets, subnets and micro-segmentation, assigning appropriate IP addresses to resources and configuring DNS name resolution.

You now have the fundamental knowledge required to design and implement virtual networking in Azure.
