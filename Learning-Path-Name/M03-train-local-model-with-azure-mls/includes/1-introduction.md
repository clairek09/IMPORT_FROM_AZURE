Once the workspace is created, you can start to build and train models.

Training a machine learning model could be as easy as loading the data and running one line of code from packages like Scikit-Learn, but most of the time the process requires more. Before you apply different models, you need to understand how the dataset looks and apply the best model.

In this module, you will use the MNIST dataset as an example to explore the Azure Machine Learning service. You can build and train your model both locally or via remote containers. You  train a simple logistic regression model and a series of kNN models to find the one with the highest accuracy. This example is an image classification problem in which you want to determine the number contained in an image.

## Learning Objectives

In this module you will:

- Create a simple logistic model to recognize numbers contained in images from the MNIST dataset
- Create a series of kNN models to find the one with the highest accuracy
- Create an Azure Machine Learning experiment
- Train a model using the Azure Machine Learning service
- Submit the model, monitor the run, and retrieve the results
