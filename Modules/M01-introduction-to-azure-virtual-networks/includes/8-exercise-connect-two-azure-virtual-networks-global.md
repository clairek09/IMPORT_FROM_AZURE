
In this unit, you will configure connectivity between the CoreServicesVnet and the ManufacturingVnet by adding peerings to allow traffic flow. 

## Create a Virtual Machine to test the configuration

In this section, you will create a test VM on the Manufacturing VNet to test if you can access resroues inside another Azure virtual network from your ManufacturingVnet.

### Create ManufacturingVM

1. On the Azure home page, select Virtual Machines.
2. In Virtual Machines, select **+ Add &gt; + Start with a preset configuration**.
   ![Virtual machines with + Add and + Start with a preset configuration highlighted.](../media/add-virtual-machine-preset.png)

3. In Choose recommended defaults that match your workload, under **Select a workload environment**, select **Dev/Test**.

4. Under **Select a workload type**, select **General purpose (D-Series)**, and then select **Continue to create a VM**.

5. Use the information in the following table to create your VM.

6. When the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.

## Connect to the Test VMs using RDP

1. On the Azure Portal home page, select **Virtual Machines**.

2. Select **ManufacturingVM**.

3. In ManufacturingVM, select **Connect &gt; RDP**.

4. In ManufacturingVM | Connect, select **Download RDP file**.

5. Save the RDP file to your desktop.

6. Connect to ManufacturingVM using the RDP file, and the username and password you specified when you created the VM.

7. On the Azure Portal home page, select **Virtual Machines**.

8. Select **TestVM1**.

9. In TestVM1, select **Connect &gt; RDP**.

10. In TestVM1 | Connect, select **Download RDP file**.

11. Save the RDP file to your desktop.

12. Connect to TestVM1 using the RDP file, and the username and password you specified when you created the VM.

13. On both VMs, in **Choose privacy settings for your device**, select **Accept**.

14. On both VMs, in **Networks**, select **Yes**.

15. On TestVM1, open a PowerShell prompt, and run the following command: ipconfig

16. Note the IPv4 address. 

 

## Test the connection between the VMs

1. On the ManufacturingVM, open a PowerShell prompt.

2. Use the following command to verify that there is no connection to TestVM1 on CoreServicesVnet. Be sure to use the IPv4 address for TestVM1.

| PowerShell                               |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389 |


3. The test connection should fail, and you will see a result similar to the following:

5. In CoreServicesVnet | Peerings, verify that the **CoreServicesVnet-to-ManufacturingVnet** peering is listed.

6. Under Virtual networks, select **ManufacturingVnet**, and verify the **ManufacturingVnet-to-CoreServicesVnet** peering is listed.

 

## Test the connection between the VMs

1. On the ManufacturingVM, open a PowerShell prompt.

2. Use the following command to verify that there is now a connection to TestVM1 on CoreServicesVnet. 

| PowerShell                               |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389 |


3. The test connection should succeed, and you will see a result similar to the following:
   ![Powershell window with Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389 showing TCP test succeeded: true](../media/test-connection-succeeded.png)

 

Congratulations! You have successful configured connectivity between VNets by adding peerings.
