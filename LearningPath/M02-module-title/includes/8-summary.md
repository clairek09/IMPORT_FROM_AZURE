In this module, you used the MNIST dataset to explore the Azure Machine Learning service. You learned that you can build and train your model both locally or via remote containers. You  trained a simple logistic regression model and a series of kNN models to find the one with the highest accuracy. The example you did was an image classification problem in which you want to determine the number contained in an image. Then you created an Azure Machine Learning experiment and used it to train a model. You submitted the model training run, monitored it, and retrieve the results.

**Run**, within the context of the Azure Machine Learning service, refers to Python code for a specific task, for example, training a model or tuning hyperparameters. Run does the job of logging metrics and upload result to Azure platform, it's a more natural way to keep track of jobs in your Workspace.

**Experiment** is a term referring to a composition of a series of runs. In the example, you have one run for the logistic regression model and another for the KNN model, and together they make up an experiment for you to compare results.

### Connect to the Internet

To access information and communicate with others using the Internet, you'll first need to connect to the Internet- or "go online". There are several ways to connect to the Internet, including both wireless and wired connections.
