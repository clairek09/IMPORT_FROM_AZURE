00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,655
>> Computers are now used
everywhere around us.

2
00:00:02,655 --> 00:00:04,450
You will find them
at work, in stores,

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,005
in hospitals, and at home.

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,820
A computer is an electronic
machine that can process,

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,320
store, and retrieve
different types

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,865
of data and information.

7
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:13,620
You can use the
computer to perform

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,120
many tasks such as
writing documents,

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,970
playing games, sending emails,

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,510
learning new skills, browsing

11
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,155
the web, and watching movies.

12
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,700
All computers consists of

13
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,565
two main parts,
hardware and software.

14
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:28,740
Software refers to the
intangible parts of a computer,

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,400
the parts that can't be touched.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,000
This includes
the instructions that

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,765
control how the
hardware functions,

18
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:35,740
the applications running
on the computer,

19
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,620
and the data stored
on the computer.

20
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,320
Hardware includes all of

21
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,300
the physical parts that
make up a computer

22
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,500
such as the monitor and

23
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,005
the central processing unit,
that keeps data moving.

24
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:46,640
There are various types
of computers

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,780
that you may encounter,

26
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,210
but they all share
the same fundamental purpose

27
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,130
of processing and
storing information.
