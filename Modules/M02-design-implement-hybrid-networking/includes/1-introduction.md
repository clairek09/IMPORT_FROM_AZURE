Imagine yourself in the role of a network engineer at an organization that is in the process of migrating to Azure and evaluating the adoption of a global transit network architecture. This network would be used to connect their growing number of distributed offices. It would also address the work from home initiatives, and control their cloud-centric modern, global enterprise IT footprint. As the network engineer you need users to be able to access resources such as file storage, databases, and applications on-premises and in Azure. You need to design and implement a hybrid connectivity solution that will address the short term and long-term goals of the organization's global enterprise IT footprint.

When an organization migrates resources and services to Azure, network architects and engineers must ensure that communication between the on-premises environment and Azure workloads is both secure and reliable.
