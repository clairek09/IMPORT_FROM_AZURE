5. To create the connection, select **Create**.

## Task 10: Verify that the connections connect 

1. In **Search resources, services, and docs (G+/)**, enter **connections**, and then select **connections** from the results.

2. Wait until the status of both connections is **Connected**. You may need to refresh your screen. 

   ![VPN Gateway connections successfully created.](../media/connections-status-connected.png)

 

## Task 11: Test the connection between the VMs

1. On the **ManufacturingTestVM**, open PowerShell.

2. Use the following command to verify that there is now a connection to CoreServicesTestVM on CoreServicesVnet. Be sure to use the IPv4 address for CoreServicesTestVM.

   ```Powershell
   Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389
   ```

3. The test connection should succeed, and you will see a result similar to the following:

   ![Test-NetConnection suceeded.](../media/test-connection-succeeded.png)

 

Congratulations! You have configured a VNet-to-VNet connection by using a virtual network gateway.
