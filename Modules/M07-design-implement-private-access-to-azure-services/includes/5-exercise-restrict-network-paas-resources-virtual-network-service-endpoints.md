Virtual network service endpoints enable you to limit network access to some Azure service resources to a virtual network subnet. You can also remove internet access to the resources. Service endpoints provide direct connection from your virtual network to supported Azure services, allowing you to use your virtual network's private address space to access the Azure services. Traffic destined to Azure resources through service endpoints always stays on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

In this exercise, you will:

 -  Task 1: Create a virtual network
 -  Task 2: Enable a service endpoint
 -  Task 3: Restrict network access for a subnet
 -  Task 4: Add additional outbound rules
 -  Task 5: Allow access for RDP connections
 -  Task 6: Restrict network access to a resource
 -  Task 7: Create a file share in the storage account
 -  Task 8: Restrict network access to a subnet
 -  Task 9: Create virtual machines
 -  Task 10: Confirm access to storage account
 -  Task 11: Clean up resources

The VM takes a few minutes to deploy. Do not continue to the next step until it finishes creating and its settings open in the portal.

## Task 10: Confirm access to storage account

1.  Once the ContosoWestPrivate VM finishes creating, open the blade for the VM by selecting Go to resource. Select the Connect button, then select RDP. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/private-virtual-machine-connect-1c139669.png" alt-text="select RDP to connect to virtual machine":::
    
2.  After selecting the Connect button and RDP, select the Download RDP File button. A Remote Desktop Protocol (.rdp) file is created and downloaded to your computer.
3.  Open the downloaded rdp file. If prompted, select Connect. Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the VM. You may need to select More choices, then Use a different account, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM.
4.  Select **OK**.
5.  You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. If you receive the warning, select Yes or Continue to proceed with the connection.
6.  On the ContosoWestPrivate VM, map the Azure file share to drive Z using PowerShell. Before running the commands that follow, replace \<storage-account-key\> , \<storage-account-name\> (i.e. contosostoragewestxx) and my-file-share (i.e marketing) with values you supplied and retrieved in the Create a storage account task.
    
    ```azurecli
       $acctKey = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "<storage-account-key>" -AsPlainText -Force
    
       $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList "Azure\<storage-account-name>", $acctKey
    
       New-PSDrive -Name Z -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\my-file-share" -Credential $credential
    
    ```
    
    The Azure file share successfully mapped to the Z drive.
7.  Confirm that the VM has no outbound connectivity to the internet from a command prompt: ping bing.com You receive no replies because the network security group associated to the Private subnet does not allow outbound access to the internet.
8.  Close the remote desktop session to the ContosoWestPrivate VM.

### Confirm access is denied to storage account

1.  Enter ContosoWestPublic In the **Search resources, services, and docs** box at the top of the portal.
2.  When **ContosoWestPublic** appears in the search results, select it.
3.  Complete steps 1-6 in the Confirm access to storage account task for the ContosoWestPublic VM.<br>‎<br>‎After a short wait, you receive a New-PSDrive : Access is denied error. Access is denied because the ContosoWestPublic VM is deployed in the Public subnet. The Public subnet does not have a service endpoint enabled for Azure Storage. The storage account only allows network access from the Private subnet, not the Public subnet.
4.  Close the remote desktop session to the ContosoWestPublic VM.
5.  From your computer, browse to the Azure portal.
6.  Enter the name of the storage account you created in the **Search resources, services, and docs** box. When the name of your storage account appears in the search results, select it.
7.  Select **File shares** then select my-file-share.
8.  You receive the error shown in the following screenshot:


:::image type="content" source="../media/no-access-1c32a070.png" alt-text="error showing no access":::


Access is denied, because your computer is not in the Private subnet of the CoreServicesVNet virtual network.

## Task 11: Clean up resources

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1.  In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
2.  Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:
    
    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'myResourceGroup' -Force -AsJob
    
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
