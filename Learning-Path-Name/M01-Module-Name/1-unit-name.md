##MSLearn
While you can continue to work with your existing artifact repositories in their current locations when using Azure DevOps, there are advantages to migrating them.
NuGet and Other Packages
Azure DevOps Services provides hosted NuGet feeds as a service. By using this service, you can often eliminate the dependencies on on-premises resources such as file shares and locally hosted instances of NuGet.Server. The feeds can also be consumed by any Continuous Integration system that supports authenticated NuGet feeds.
